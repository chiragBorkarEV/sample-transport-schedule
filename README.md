## Disclaimers

I removed unwanted code which was part of this boilerplate.
This code not have any test coverage as assignment didnt mention it but its always good practice to have unit test run against the code.
Kept theme as grey against colored as it was not primariliy style focused assignment.
Use jss against css as local styling approach avoid any global class collisions.
I wasn't sure about search behavior either user needs to press button click action or UI should show result as user types, so I followed the later approach though its not pro performance, but switching to any another approach would be easy as we can still use existing fetch functionality.
I will try to deploy this code to github pages, not sure about its outcome. If worked I will update the link in the 'Deployment' section.

## Symbol Definition 

Half Moon : Night Service
Clock: Disruptions

## External Depenancies

I have used couple of them just to make sure life is more easy for responsive implementation as well few OOB featured needed for this implementation.

## Approach

I tried to make my best guess to implement this, but same problem can be solve in diffrent way if know the bigger picture and can estimate the data in terms of its volume and priority for the use case in terms of performance, user experience, look and feel etc.
